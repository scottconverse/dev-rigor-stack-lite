# Standing dev rigor stack Lite v0.3.3

Two altitudes. The **per-unit loop** (gates 1–5) applies to EVERY unit of work — a
fix, a module, a feature. The **release gate** fires once per version, at the tag
boundary, on the aggregate of all merged units. A red result at any gate returns to
the phase that owns it — never route around a gate, never merge or tag past it.

## Standalone entrypoints

Every functional section is independently invokable and also routed by this coordinator:

- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-continuity`
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-plan`
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-build` (backward-compatible `$coder-tdd-qa-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-proof-gate` (backward-compatible `$proof-gate-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-audit-lite` (short name `$quick-audit-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-audit-team` (backward-compatible `$audit-team-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-walkthrough`
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-visitor-audit` (backward-compatible `$visitor-audit-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-gauntletgate` (backward-compatible `$gauntletgate-lite`)
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-merge-gate`
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-docs-gate`
- `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-release`

Namespaced entrypoints load the complete canonical sibling contract; they are not compact
rewrites. Missing or unreadable required skills make the affected gate INVALID rather than
silently degrading to a weaker approximation.

Read `references/artifact-contracts.md` before running the stack. Require each stage to
emit or consume the applicable run manifest, claims, findings, coverage, handoff, and gate
result without changing upstream evidence or losing artifact identity.

## Session & machine continuity

Standalone: `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-continuity`.

Continuity, not a gate — a bookend on each side of the loop, sitting above it. Nothing
passes or fails here; it ensures only that durable project state outlives a session or
machine switch.

Durable state — locked decisions, done-criteria, and killed approaches (each with the
reason it was rejected) — lives in a **remote-tracked, append-safe artifact**, never
only in context:

- **The artifact** — remote-tracked (survives session/machine changes) and append-safe,
  so interleaved clients, sessions, and machines don't clobber each other; that's
  why a comment-append store beats a lone in-repo file that merge-conflicts. Mechanism is
  the project's to pick, not the skill's — point at one that already exists (a
  project-memory vault such as the `claude-dev-loop` skill if present, a pinned decision
  Issue, or a grep-able in-repo file), never a second store beside one you already have.
- **Start** — pull and read state before entering the loop. Honor settled decisions as
  defaults, but re-validate any resting on a fact that can go stale before relying on it
  — recalled state reflects what was true when written. Don't blindly re-plan what's
  settled; don't blindly obey a rejection whose blocker is now gone.
- **During** — append each locked decision and dead end as it happens; an unlogged
  rejected spike gets re-proposed next session on another machine.
- **End** — writing state, pushing it, and confirming the remote moved is the session's
  LAST action. An unconfirmed push is worse than none — the next machine pulls stale
  state believing it's current; the next Start's clean pull is the proof.

State lives for the project's duration and purges at project retirement — not per release
tag (a decision killed in 0.1 is still worth not reopening in 0.4).

## Per-unit loop (every unit of work)

1. PLAN (main-thread coordinator)
   Standalone: `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-plan`.
   Trace the real code end-to-end before touching it. Climb the reuse-before-build
   ladder (does this need to exist at all? is it already here? does stdlib or the
   platform do it? can it be one line?). Write the acceptance criteria / definition of done and the
   TEST LIST up front. **Classify the unit's blast radius here** — that sets the
   review depth and fires the escalators (below). Blast radius, not diff size, is the
   sizing axis: a one-line change to auth is small in lines and large in blast.

2. BUILD — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-build` / `$coder-tdd-qa-lite`, test-first
   Write the failing tests from the test list FIRST (or reproduce-red for a bug),
   watching each FAIL before you make it pass — that, not a percentage, is what makes
   a test real. Then minimum code to pass, then refactor green. Static gates:
   types-strict + lint. Coverage is a **gap diagnostic** (flags untested branches),
   not a threshold to clear — the exact policy lives in coder-tdd-qa-lite. Fan-out (test
   generation across combos, sweeping for latent siblings) uses the host's bounded
   multi-agent tools when available. If no bounded fan-out exists, run the same checks
   serially from a fresh adversarial vantage. If workers produce parallel branches,
   merge them one at a time (linearize) and re-verify after each.

3. VERIFY — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-proof-gate` / `$proof-gate-lite`
   Adversarially try to BREAK the claim ("this holds", "the race can't occur", "the
   number isn't inflated"). Skeptics run as a workflow on cheap models; the claim only
   survives if they cannot refute it. For a low-blast unit, VERIFY and REVIEW may
   collapse into one adversarial pass — don't run both formally over a one-liner.

   **Deterministic-detector harness (when the repo has it — the
   [deterministic-detector](https://github.com/scottconverse/deterministic-detector)
   CI jobs, plus its editor hook on hosts that support it; degrade silently if
   absent):** consume its outputs proportionally to the unit's blast radius from
   PLAN. Low blast: same-turn lint feedback is enough — no detector evidence
   required. Medium+: a green randomized-order CI run (randomized-suite job, seed
   in the log) IS the test-evidence standard — a fixed-order local pass does not
   count as "tests pass". High blast / release gate: the advisory mutation-report
   for the changed files must be PRESENT in the gate output and its survivors
   dispositioned (killed, equivalent, or accepted-with-reason) — it still cannot
   solely red the gate, and no agent ever touches required-status-check or
   branch-protection settings (owner-only, after burn-in).

4. REVIEW — the coordinator picks the proportionate review lane for what this
   slice touched, and dispatches a bounded subagent when available. Otherwise, run the
   same review serially from a fresh adversarial posture:
   • `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-audit-lite` / `$quick-audit-lite` — default; a scoped diff, a slice,
     an end-of-slice read.
   • `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-audit-team` / `$audit-team-lite` — escalate for high-blast units.
   • `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-walkthrough` — user-facing wiring and black-box newcomer truth:
     acquisition/installer lifecycle when release-scoped, every inventoried screen,
     control, distinct path and visual state, then white-box function wiring.
   • `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-visitor-audit` / `$visitor-audit-lite` — PUBLIC SURFACE lane, only
     when the unit changes an already-live
     README, docs site, landing page, release page, announcement, or published asset.
     Audit the rendered surface after publication, follow every link, and verify quoted
     checksums/sizes against the published asset. Source inspection or CI is not a pass.
   (These are the per-unit *review reports*. GauntletGate as the full advancement
   stage-gate — its `lite`/`full` lanes plus a pass/fail verdict — belongs to the RELEASE
   gate below, not here. Its `lite`/`full` lanes re-run the same discipline as quick-audit-lite
   and audit-team-lite, self-contained, because a gate can't invoke a separate skill mid-run.)
   **What counts as a finding:** a REAL defect. An incorrect finding or tool
   false-positive is classified OUT, with the reason it isn't real — that is the
   boundary of "finding," not a back door. Guard both failure modes: never contort
   correct code to satisfy a wrong tool, and never pass a real defect by calling it a
   false positive.

5. MERGE — green-path decision and execution only when authorized.
   Standalone evidence decision: `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-merge-gate`.
   Prefer units landing on the integration line through a green PR. Passing gates proves
   readiness; it does not grant permission to merge. Execute a merge only when the user or
   host policy authorizes it. Never use admin override or bypass branch protection.

## Evaluator-owned exits (goal loops)

Where the platform provides goal-based loops or evaluator-owned task loops, phrase each
BUILD/VERIFY unit as a goal with a **deterministic exit** and an explicit **try cap** —
"tests green", "0 broken links", "Lighthouse ≥ 90, stop after 5 tries" — so a separate
evaluator, not the model that did the work, owns "done". Worker ≠ judge is the same
principle as never-review-your-own-work, applied to the stop condition itself: the
builder can't talk its way past a checker that reruns the check. Criteria a model has
to interpret ("make it good") don't qualify; if the exit can't be checked
deterministically, it isn't a goal exit — route it through VERIFY/REVIEW instead.

## Release gate (once per version, before the tag — a different altitude than a unit)

Fires after the last slice of a version has merged. Use an independent worker when the host
supports it and the user or host policy permits it; otherwise run an explicitly adversarial
serial pass and disclose that independence was unavailable.

- **Full gauntlet** — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-gauntletgate all` / `$gauntletgate-lite all` →
  drive all 5 severity levels to **0/0/0/0/0**
  (blocker → nit). Findings route back into the per-unit loop until zero. The only way
  to clear a finding is to **fix it** (not-real findings are classified out per gate
  4). No waiver, no freeze, no deferred backlog.
- **Claim refutation** — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-proof-gate` against the release *claims*:
  the README, manual,
  and landing page must not promise what the product doesn't do. Gauntletgate catches a
  dead link; only claim-refutation catches an honest-looking page that overclaims.
- **Candidate public-surface pass** — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-visitor-audit` against rendered
  staging/candidate
  surfaces before the owner go/no-go. Every surface is read in full and every link is
  counted. Unpublished surfaces remain explicitly unproven; source-file review is not a
  substitute for the live pass below.
- **Candidate newcomer/product pass** — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-walkthrough` against the
  packaged candidate in a verified clean environment. Exercise the installer lifecycle,
  every inventoried screen/control/distinct path/state, visual/accessibility quality, and
  actual interface-to-function wiring. Missing denominators or clean-state proof is INVALID.
- **Deliverable docs real & complete** — `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-docs-gate`: a true README;
  a two-voice user manual
  (non-technical + technical); an architecture section with professional-grade
  drawings; an honest marketing landing page (what it is, how it fits, the value — no
  overclaiming, every link live).
- **Rollback defined before the tag** — name the trigger (what signal reverts) and the
  owner who calls it.
- **Evidence inventory closes cleanly** — every acceptance claim and real finding must have
  a current result bound to the exact commit or artifact. Record passed, failed, blocked,
  skipped, and unverifiable items explicitly. A missing host hook or private ledger is not
  required in this skills-only edition; commands, logs, screenshots, traces, CI results,
  hashes, and review artifacts are the evidence boundary.
- **STOP → owner go/no-go on the tag.** The coordinator drives everything to ready,
  then hands the decision to the owner unless publication was explicitly requested already.
- **Post-deploy closure** — after an authorized tag/publish/deploy, run
  `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-visitor-audit`
  again against the live URLs and actual release assets, cache-busted. Until this is
  clean, do not announce the release as complete, close the release workflow, or retire
  rollback readiness. Consume its acquisition handoff and run full published
  `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-walkthrough` from the public front door through download, clean-machine
  install, complete product journey, update/repair/uninstall, and visual/UI audit. A dead
  download, false current-version claim, wrong checksum, invalid coverage ledger, or broken
  newcomer journey is a release blocker and routes to correction or rollback.

The complete standalone release coordinator is `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-release`.

Cost of pure-zero: with no freeze, a nit found after the gauntlet ran moves the tagged
artifact one commit off the one you proved. Re-run the gate **at the blast radius of
the fix** — a nit re-runs only the lane it touched, not the full gauntlet — enough to
restore tag == proven-artifact. Never skip it: skipping saves a bounded, scopeable cost
but ships an unverified delta and breaks the invariant the tag stands for —
release-altitude theater, however small the fix looked. So pure-zero raises the value of
driving every slice to zero at per-unit REVIEW; pure-zero and thorough per-unit review
are the same bet.

## Owner vs coordinator decisions

The coordinator (main-thread) decides everything reversible, in-spec, and
in-sandbox, and **never originates an owner decision** on its own initiative. The line
is a principle, not just a list: a decision is the owner's when it is **irreversible,
crosses a trust boundary, or exposes external value** — i.e. being wrong costs
something the model can't take back or wasn't authorized to spend. Instances:
1. **Scope & intent** — what to build, what "done" means, changing acceptance criteria.
2. **Crossing into the world** — publishing, tagging/releasing, deploying,
   sending/posting externally, spending money, deleting data the model didn't create.
   (Merging a reviewed green PR to the integration line is NOT this; a direct push
   bypassing PR/CI is.)
3. **Risk acceptance / gate overrides** — shipping with a known blocker, merging red,
   bypassing a gate.
4. **Trust-boundary & value calls** — security, privacy, licensing, legal/ethical/
   reputational weight.
5. **Go / no-go / priority / budget.**

Reconciliation (keeps this from meaning "ask permission constantly") — it's about who
**originates** the call:
- **Explicit request** ("tag 1.7.0") = the owner deciding live → execute now, no "are
  you sure."
- **Standing authorization** (green-path unit merges are pre-approved) = decided ahead
  → proceed.
- **Neither** = surface with a recommendation, and hold.
Concretely: green-path unit merge = standing authorization; the release tag = owner
decision, every time.

## Documentation discipline

Standalone gate: `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-docs-gate`.

- **Deliverable docs — real and professional, always.** README, two-voice manual
  (non-technical + technical), architecture + professional drawings, honest landing
  page. Produced/updated at the release gate; per-unit, update only the deliverable doc
  a slice actually changes.
- **Process artifacts — ephemeral, never hoarded.** Audits, status docs, handoffs,
  scratch — keep out of the repo (or a transient dir) and purge them. Over-documenting
  the wrong thing buries a repo in stale audits; YAGNI applies to docs too.
- **Exception — evidence outlives its decision, not the model's convenience.** The
  aggregate gauntlet report is not a purgeable process artifact while a live decision
  rests on it: it persists through the tag and the rollback window, then purges. A
  go/no-go must run on evidence in hand, not memory of it.

## Dependencies & degrade-if-missing

The bundle contains Markdown skills plus their scripts, references, and templates. It has
no lifecycle hooks, background runtime, trust activator, Stop interception, or private state
ledger. Enforcement is therefore instructional: the active agent must run the checks and
retain ordinary evidence artifacts. If a lane is missing or unreadable, mark that lane
INVALID; do not silently claim the complete stack ran. Host capabilities and higher-priority
instructions always govern tool use, delegation, approvals, merges, and publication.

**audit-lite / audit-team-lite vs. gauntletgate-lite** overlap by design — the same review
discipline in two packagings. The standalone audits are the per-unit *review reports*
(gate 4); gauntletgate-lite is the release-altitude *advancement gate*, and its `lite`/`full`
lanes re-run that same discipline self-contained (a gate can't invoke a separate skill
mid-run) plus a pass/fail verdict, a first-run attestation, and the `walkthrough` lane.
Same discipline, different altitude — a report vs. a gate.

## Cross-cutting, always on

- Use bounded workers only when the host provides them and delegation is authorized. Keep
  synthesis and the final gate decision with the coordinator. Otherwise use serial passes.
- Worker tier calibration (fan-out only): every worker states its tier and moderates
  rigor by it — the paste-in wording is the fan-out preamble below.
- Open-source-first: verify licenses; prefer MIT/Apache/MPL over BUSL/SSPL/closed.
- Evidence over claims: reproduce before fixing, verify with numbers, never claim
  beyond the evidence, own mistakes plainly.
- Code minimalism governs CODE SCOPE ONLY — reuse-before-build and the shortest working
  diff shrink the *code*, never a gate, a CI check, verification, or subagent discipline.

The stack FLEXES to the unit — sequential fixes skip fan-out, low-blast units collapse
VERIFY+REVIEW, user-invisible changes skip the walkthrough lane — but the gates that
apply are not optional, and a skip is stated with a reason, never silent.

---

Fan-out worker preamble (paste the matching line at the top of each agent() prompt):

[worker] You are a bounded worker. Your known failure mode is passing your own "looks
right" review instead of running a check that can fail. For every claim, run the real
check and paste the exact command and its verbatim output.

[mechanical worker] You are a worker on a mechanical task. Every result needs a named
artifact — exact command + output. Do not claim "verified" from inspection. If this
task turns out to need judgment or synthesis, stop and say so; do not guess.
