# Dev Rigor Stack — GauntletGate

Read `../gauntletgate-lite/SKILL.md` and every reference and selected lane it requires
completely. Apply it without abbreviation. That sibling is the canonical implementation
and backward-compatible `$gauntletgate-lite` entrypoint.

The Walkthrough lane must consume `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-walkthrough`; public-facing release
scope must also consume `$dev-rigor-stack-lite-visitor-audit`. The overall stack sets the gate
threshold to strict-zero: 0 Blocker / 0 Critical / 0 Major / 0 Minor / 0 Nit.
